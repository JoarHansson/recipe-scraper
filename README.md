# recipe-scraper
This repository contains a group project for the TypeScript assignment at [Yrgo](https://www.yrgo.se/program/webbutvecklare/). The project was carried out by [Julia Göransson](https://github.com/juliasophieG), [Joar Hansson](https://github.com/JoharHansson) and [Siri Sjölin](https://github.com/sirisayshello).

Besides TypeScript the tools that are used in the project are NodeJS and Express for the server, and React for the frontend. Additionally, Playwright is used for web scraping. 

### Introduction

Our group has grown tired of navigating lengthy online recipes filled with pictures, ads, and long-winded explanations about why a certain recipe is the best. This makes it difficult to get started and requires constant scrolling between ingredients and instructions. To address this frustration, we decided to use web scraping to extract only the essential information from recipes.

### Installation

A step by step guide that will tell you how to get the development environment up and running.

```
$ cd server
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Keep the server running and open another terminal window in the project root:

```
$ cd client
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Now go to the client's url to test the application.
